# Current Plan

## Objective
Bootstrap or refresh the repository's AI agent stack so future agents inherit accurate guidance and reusable workflows.

## Scope
Included:
- Root guidance files
- Custom agents and selected skills
- Memory-bank and runbook scaffolding

Excluded:
- Unpinned third-party imports
- Destructive automation or hooks

## Plan
1. Inventory the repository's purpose, stack, commands, workflows, and current AI assets.
2. Render a repo-specific hybrid stack with managed sections and provenance metadata.
3. Validate the generated stack and hand back any drift or follow-up items.

## Validation
- `python -m pip install nbconvert`
- `├── criteria.json         # Test specs: command, stdin, expected_stdout, points`

## Completion criteria
- Core files exist and validate cleanly.
- Each agent exposes the delegation tool and focused tool access.
- Managed updates preserve user-authored content outside generated sections.
