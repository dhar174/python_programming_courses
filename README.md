# Python Programming Course Package (96 Hours)

This repository contains the complete instructional materials for the **Python Programming** course package delivered by **GlobalIT** and taught by **Charles Niswander**. The course is a comprehensive, instructor-led, hands-on, project-based program aligned to the **Python Institute** certification pathway.

The course package is comprised of two full modules:

- **Module 1: Python Programming (Basic) – 48 Hours**
- **Module 2: Python Programming (Advanced) – 48 Hours**

This README is derived from the “Python GIT Training Course Package” description and is intended to provide a clear overview of the course scope, objectives, outcomes, and logistics for learners, instructors, and stakeholders.
