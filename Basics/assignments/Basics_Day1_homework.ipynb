# Python Basics - Day 1 Homework\n\n**Topics Covered:**\n- Environment setup and orientation\n- First scripts: print(), comments, and reading errors\n- Variables and basic types\n- Numbers and operators\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Complete all exercises in order\n- Write your code in the provided cells\n- Test your code by running the cell (Shift+Enter)\n- Use modern Python practices: f-strings, type hints, clear variable names\n- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines\n- Add comments to explain your reasoning where appropriate\n\n**Submission:**\n- Save your completed notebook\n- Ensure all cells run without errors\n- Submit according to your instructor's guidelines\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd16 Autograder Integration\n\nThis assignment is graded automatically by the **Global Autograder**. Please follow these rules carefully:\n\n- **All solution code MUST be present and runnable** in this notebook.\n- The autograder converts this notebook to `day1.py` and grades it against `criteria.json`.\n- **Outputs must exactly match** the canonical strings in `criteria.json` for all graded exercises *except for the environment info in Exercise 1.1*.\n  - Example: `Addition: 22`, `Subtotal: 85.50`\n  - No extra whitespace, punctuation, or incorrect ordering.\n- **Numeric outputs** must show correct precision (e.g., 2 decimal places for money: `85.50`, not `85.5`).\n- All `print()` statements must be **deterministic** (no randomness or unseeded state). *Note: For Exercise 1.1, your name and the current date are expected to be dynamic; the autograder only checks for the labels (`Student:`, `Date:`).*\n- The notebook must **NOT** read or write files outside the assignment directory.\n- **Run all cells** and ensure no errors before submission.\n- **Do not rename** this notebook file, move it to a different directory, or alter the config files (`criteria.json`, `setup.json`). Doing so will break the autograder workflow.\n\nA helper cell at the end of this notebook provides a canonical script (`day1.py`) showing the exact expected outputs for each graded section. Use it to preview and debug before submission.
