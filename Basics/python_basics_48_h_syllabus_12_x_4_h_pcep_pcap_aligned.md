# Python Programming for Developers — Basics (48 Hours)

## Course description
Python is a versatile, in‑demand language used across automation, web development, data work, and more. This 48‑hour, instructor‑led course takes learners from first scripts through intermediate fundamentals.

Learners will practice:
- Core data types and collections
- Control flow (conditionals and loops)
- Functions and modules
- An introduction to classes
- File I/O (text + JSON)
- Exception handling

The course culminates in a practical command‑line capstone project and a certification‑style review.

## Target audience
- Aspiring programmers and junior developers
- QA/automation and IT professionals who need Python for scripting
- Learners preparing for entry‑level Python certification

## Prerequisites
- Basic computer literacy
- Prior programming experience is helpful but not required

## Duration and schedule
- **Total instructional time:** 48 hours
- **Delivery format:** Instructor‑led (virtual or in‑person)
- **Schedule:** **12 class meetings × 4 hours each**
- **Recommended session rhythm:** recap → concept → demo → guided practice/lab → debrief (with a midpoint break)

## Learning outcomes
By the end of the course, learners will be able to:
- Set up a Python 3 environment and run scripts
- Use core data types/operators and core collections (list/tuple/set/dict)
- Implement control flow with conditionals and loops
- Write organized code with functions and modules; introduce basic classes
- Read/write files (text + JSON) and handle runtime/file errors with exceptions
- Build and present a small command‑line capstone project

# 12‑day syllabus schedule (12 sessions × 4 hours)

> **Note:** Each session includes hands‑on labs and short knowledge checks aligned to the runbook checkpoints.

| Day | 4‑Hour Session Focus | Key deliverables |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Orientation, tooling, running scripts; variables and expressions; console I/O | First scripts; environment verified |
| 2 | Strings + methods; formatting; numeric conversion; input validation patterns | **Checkpoint 1** |
| 3 | Comparisons and Boolean logic; string parsing (split/join); debugging habits | Practice set |
| 4 | Lists: create/update; iteration; list methods; nested lists | **Checkpoint 2** |
| 5 | Tuples + unpacking; sets; dictionaries; dict iteration patterns | Data‑structure drills |
| 6 | Choosing structures; mini‑project lab; review and reinforcement | **Checkpoint 3** |
| 7 | Conditionals in depth; while loops; for loops; range; loop patterns | Guided lab |
| 8 | CLI menu loops; input validation and state; mini‑project lab | **Checkpoint 4** |
| 9 | Functions (params/return); scope; docstrings; modules/imports | Modular refactor lab |
| 10 | Intro OOP: classes, attributes, methods; collections of objects | **Checkpoint 5** |
| 11 | File I/O (text); JSON persistence; directories/paths; exceptions for I/O | Persistence lab |
| 12 | Capstone build/polish; demo; final assessment + certification‑style review | Capstone demo + review |

# Assessments and completion criteria
## Checkpoints
- **Five checkpoints** distributed across the course to validate mastery of core skills:
  - Fundamentals + strings
  - Lists
  - Data structures (tuple/set/dict)
  - Control flow (if/loops/menu)
  - Functions/modules + intro OOP

## Capstone
**CLI Personal Organizer** (or equivalent) demonstrating:
- A menu‑driven loop (add/edit/delete/view)
- Functions organized into modules
- At least one class (e.g., Task/Note/Contact)
- JSON persistence to a data folder
- Exception handling for input and file/JSON errors

## Final assessment
- Capstone presentation and rubric scoring
- Short certification‑style review/quiz

# Certification alignment (PCEP / PCAP)

## PCEP (Certified Entry‑Level Python Programmer)
PCEP focuses on fundamentals, control flow, collections, and functions/exceptions.

**Course alignment:**
- **Fundamentals:** Days 1–2
- **Control Flow:** Days 3, 7–8
- **Collections:** Days 2–6
- **Functions & Exceptions:** Days 9–12

## PCAP (Certified Associate in Python Programming)
PCAP expands into modules/packages, strings, exceptions, OOP, and I/O.

**Course alignment (intro coverage):**
- **Strings:** Days 2–3
- **Modules:** Day 9
- **OOP (intro):** Day 10
- **I/O:** Day 11
- **Exceptions:** Days 11–12

> **Positioning:** This Basics course builds strong PCEP readiness and introduces PCAP topics; full PCAP readiness is typically achieved by pairing with the follow‑on Advanced course.

---

# Tools, platforms, and environment
- Python 3.x environment (local or remote lab)
- Code editor/IDE (e.g., VS Code) recommended
- File system access for I/O and JSON persistence labs

---

# Scope boundaries (kept for Advanced)
To keep Basics focused, the following are explicitly out‑of‑scope and reserved for more advanced training:
- Web frameworks/APIs (e.g., Flask/FastAPI)
- Databases/SQL
- GUI frameworks
- Testing frameworks (pytest/coverage)
- Packaging/deployment
- Data science/ML toolchains

---

# Suggested pacing notes (instructor)
- Reinforce habits early: naming, formatting, incremental testing, and debugging.
- Keep demos short and lab time generous.
- Use checkpoints to identify remediation needs before proceeding.
- Encourage learners to refactor into functions/modules by Day 9 to set up capstone success.
