# Answer Key and Explanations

## Section 1: Environment and Setup

### Question 1: **D**
**Explanation:** Both `python --version` and `python -v` work to check the Python version. The double-dash `--version` is more explicit and commonly used, while `-v` is a shorthand. On some systems, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python`.

### Question 2: **C**
**Explanation:** Python scripts use the `.py` file extension. This tells the operating system and editors that the file contains Python code.

### Question 3: **B**
**Explanation:** The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is interactive - you type one line at a time and see immediate results. A `.py` file contains a complete script that runs from top to bottom when executed. The REPL is great for testing small snippets; scripts are better for complete programs.

### Question 4: **B**
**Explanation:** Keeping your files in a consistent workspace folder helps Python find modules when you import them and keeps file paths predictable. While it's not strictly required, it's a professional practice that prevents many common errors.

### Question 5: **C**
**Explanation:** In cloud-based lab environments (like LogicalLabs), you should save all your files before taking a break. Many systems have a "Save and Suspend" feature that preserves your work even if the connection times out. This prevents losing unsaved work.

## Section 2: Print, Comments, and Errors

### Question 6: **B**
**Explanation:** In Python 3, `print()` is a function and requires parentheses. Python 2 used `print` as a statement without parentheses, but that's deprecated.

### Question 7: **C**
**Explanation:** Python uses `#` for single-line comments. Everything after `#` on that line is ignored by the interpreter. Other languages use different syntax: `//` in Java/JavaScript, `/* */` in C, `--` in SQL.

### Question 8: **B**
**Explanation:** Each `print()` statement outputs to a new line by default. So you'll see:
```
Python
is
awesome!
```
To print on the same line, you'd need to use `print("Python", end=" ")` or concatenate strings.

### Question 9: **C**
**Explanation:** `print("Hello)` is missing the closing quote, which causes a syntax error. Python won't know where the string ends. Options A, B, and D are all syntactically correct.

### Question 10: **D**
**Explanation:** Python error messages (tracebacks) provide the error type (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `NameError`), the file name and line number where the error occurred, and a description of the problem. Learning to read these messages is a crucial skill.

---

## Section 3: Variables and Types

### Question 11: **C**
**Explanation:** Variable names in Python can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot contain hyphens (dashes). `student-name` would be interpreted as `student minus name`. Use `student_name` (snake_case) instead.

### Question 12: **A**
**Explanation:** When you assign `y = x`, `y` gets the *value* that `x` currently holds (5). Changing `x` to 10 later doesn't affect `y`. This is because integers are immutable and assignment creates a copy of the value, not a reference.

### Question 13: **C**
**Explanation:** `42` is an integer (`int`). Python 3 integers can be arbitrarily large and have no maximum size (unlike some other languages).

### Question 14: **B**
**Explanation:** `"42"` is a string (`str`) because it's enclosed in quotes. Even though it looks like a number, the quotes make it text. You'd need to convert it with `int("42")` to use it as a number.

### Question 15: **B**
**Explanation:** The `type()` function returns the data type of a variable or value. For example, `type(42)` returns `<class 'int'>`.

### Question 16: **B**
**Explanation:** Python uses `<class 'str'>` and `<class 'int'>` notation when printing types. The "class" terminology reflects that all types in Python are actually classes.

### Question 17: **C**
**Explanation:** `True` (with a capital T) is a boolean value in Python. `"True"` is a string, `1` is an integer (though it can be used in boolean contexts), and `yes` is not a Python keyword.

### Question 18: **C**
**Explanation:** Using an undefined variable causes a `NameError` with a message like "name 'variable_name' is not defined". This helps catch typos in variable names. Always define variables before using them.

## Section 4: Numbers and Operators

### Question 19: **B**
**Explanation:** Following operator precedence (order of operations), multiplication happens before addition: `5 * 2 = 10`, then `10 + 10 = 20`. Remember PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

### Question 20: **A**
**Explanation:** Parentheses change the order: `(10 + 5) = 15` is calculated first, then `15 * 2 = 30`. Use parentheses to make your intent clear.

### Question 21: **C**
**Explanation:** The modulus operator `%` returns the remainder after division. It's useful for checking if numbers are even/odd, or for wrapping values in a range.

### Question 22: **B**
**Explanation:** `17 ÷ 5 = 3` with a remainder of `2`. The modulus operator `%` gives us that remainder: `17 % 5 = 2`.

### Question 23: **B**
**Explanation:** In Python 3, `/` always performs "true division" and returns a float (e.g., `10 / 3 = 3.333...`). The `//` operator performs "floor division" and returns an integer (e.g., `10 // 3 = 3`).

### Question 24: **D**
**Explanation:** `10 / 3` returns a float: `3.3333333333333335`. Python shows many decimal places. If you want to display fewer, use `round()` or f-string formatting.

### Question 25: **A**
**Explanation:** `10 // 3` uses floor division and returns `3` (an integer). It's like regular division but throws away the remainder.

### Question 26: **B**
**Explanation:** Python uses `**` for exponentiation. For example, `2 ** 3` means "2 to the power of 3". Note that `^` is used for bitwise XOR in Python, not exponentiation.

### Question 27: **C**
**Explanation:** `2 ** 3` means "2 to the power of 3" or "2 × 2 × 2 = 8".

### Question 28: **B**
**Explanation:** First, `x` is assigned `10`. Then, the expression `x + 5` evaluates to `15`, which is assigned back to `x`. Finally, `x` is printed: `15`.

### Question 29: **B**
**Explanation:** The augmented assignment operator `+=` is shorthand for `x = x + 5`. It's more concise and clearer. Similar operators exist: `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc. Note: `x =+ 5` is not the same - it means `x = +5`.

### Question 30: **D**
**Explanation:** Both approaches work:
- `round(3.14159, 2)` returns `3.14`
- `f"{3.14159:.2f}"` formats as a string with 2 decimal places: `"3.14"`

The f-string approach is often preferred for display because it always shows exactly 2 digits (e.g., `3.50` instead of `3.5`).
