Instructor Runbook
Python Programming (Basic) – 48 Hours

Delivery format: 12 sessions × 4 instructional hours (48 total)

Prepared for delivery • January 13, 2026

# How to use this runbook

This runbook is a teaching companion for a 48-hour Python Basics course delivered as 12 sessions of 4 instructional hours each. It includes: session flow, hour-by-hour lesson blocks, live demo steps, lab prompts, checkpoint assessments, rubrics, and troubleshooting tips.

Pacing note for 4-hour sessions: plan one 10-minute break around the midpoint, plus a 3–5 minute micro-break as needed. The hour blocks below are instructional hours.

# Courseware alignment note (Logical Operations + our 48-hour format)

This course aligns to the Logical Operations "Introduction to Programming with Python (Second Edition)" topic scope, but is delivered as 48 instructional hours to support:
• More guided practice time per topic (demo → guided lab → independent lab).
• Five checkpoints plus a structured capstone build sprint.
• Dedicated remediation time (debugging habits, code reading, and fundamentals reinforcement).
• Certification-style review and individual feedback without introducing Advanced-only topics.

This added time is intentional: it increases practice density and lowers learner drop-off while staying within the Python Basics scope.

# Course outcomes (Basic)

Set up a Python 3 development environment and run scripts.

Use core data types (numbers, strings, booleans) and operators.

Work with core data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries).

Implement control flow using conditionals and loops.

Write and organize code with functions and modules; introduce basic classes.

Read/write files (text and JSON) and handle common errors with exceptions.

List directory contents and manage basic file/directory operations using pathlib.

Apply basic Python style standards (readable naming, indentation, and consistent formatting).

Build and present a small command-line capstone project.

# Delivery environment standard (LogicalCHOICE + LogicalLabs)

Primary delivery environment: LogicalCHOICE is the "home base" for course content and provides the tile used to launch LogicalLabs in a new browser tab. Students complete hands-on work inside the remote lab VM. Pop-up blockers can prevent the lab from launching.

Credentialing note (two-key process): Students may have separate access keys for the course content (CHOICE) vs the lab VM (LogicalLab / Lab Access Key). Instructors must explicitly guide students to redeem the Lab Access Key from the Current Training page via "Redeem Training Key" so they can launch the VM.

Operational norm: Establish a "Save and Suspend" culture before breaks longer than ~15 minutes (Save All in IDE; relaunch from the LogicalCHOICE tile if the VM disconnects).

*(Grounding: CHOICE as content hub + lab gateway, two-key redemption, new tab / pop-up blockers, and save/suspend expectations are called out as frequent friction points.)*

# Pre-course instructor checklist

Verify LogicalCHOICE access for all learners and confirm the lab tile launches LogicalLabs in a new browser tab (test with pop-up blockers on/off).

Confirm learners understand the two-key process: CHOICE Key unlocks courseware; Lab Access Key provisions the VM. Verify students can find "Redeem Training Key" in Current Training.

Validate workstation/browser requirements: Chrome/Firefox/Safari supported; ensure JavaScript is enabled and aggressive blockers aren't interfering.

Verify Python 3 is available in the lab image/VM; confirm VS Code (or editor) launches cleanly.

Confirm the "workspace path" learners should use (where files persist) and test persistence: create a file → Save All → disconnect/relaunch → confirm file remains.

Open a sample project folder and run a simple script to confirm permissions and file paths work.

Confirm internet access policy (if any) and whether installing packages is allowed (Basics can be done without pip).

Prepare a shared class repo or zip of starter files (blank templates + checkpoint starter code).

Decide how you will collect labs (screenshare, LMS upload, Git, or file submission).

Post the ‘common errors’ quick sheet (indentation, type conversion, file paths).

# Session delivery rhythm (recommended)

Start-of-session (5–10 min): recap + 1 warm-up question.

Teach (10–15 min): concept + examples + quick questions.

Demo (5–10 min): live coding with narration; ask learners to predict output.

Lab (25–35 min): guided → independent; circulate and spot-check.

Debrief (5 min): 2–3 learners share solutions; highlight common fixes.

# 48-hour hour-by-hour lesson blocks

Each hour block includes: outcomes, instructor talk points, demo, lab prompt, completion criteria, common pitfalls, and optional extensions (still within Basics scope).

| Requirements met | Menu loop, functions split into modules, at least one class, JSON persistence, exception handling. |
| User experience | Clear prompts, confirmations, and readable output. |
| Code organization | Logical file structure; functions/classes have clear responsibility. |
| Data persistence | Save/load works across runs; handles missing/corrupt file gracefully. |
| Demo & explanation | Learner can explain their approach and show key features in <3 minutes. |

# Troubleshooting quick guide (Basics)

| Symptom | Fast fix |
| --- | --- |
| IndentationError | Check inconsistent tabs/spaces; reindent the block with spaces (4). |
| NameError | Variable misspelling or used before assignment; check exact casing. |
| TypeError (can’t add str + int) | Convert input to int/float before math; use f-strings for output. |
| ValueError on int()/float() | Input wasn’t numeric; add validation or try/except and re-prompt. |
| IndexError | Index out of range; print len(list) and check boundaries. |
| KeyError | Missing dict key; use 'in' check or dict.get(). |
| FileNotFoundError | Wrong path; print current working directory; use pathlib and create data/ folder. |
| JSONDecodeError | Corrupted JSON; catch it and reset to defaults or restore from backup. |

## Pacing adjustments

If learners are ahead: use the ‘Optional extensions’ and have them explain tradeoffs.

If learners are behind: shorten lecture, do one extra guided example, and reduce lab scope to MVP.

For 4-hour sessions: consider assigning optional extensions as homework instead of in-session work.

# No-go topics for the Basics course (keep for Advanced)

Web frameworks (Flask/Django), REST APIs

Databases/SQL/ORM

GUI frameworks (Tkinter/PyQt)

Testing frameworks (pytest), coverage tooling
